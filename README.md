# gemGIF

GemGIF creates a shareable GIF for that exact moment you’re thinking of from your favorite movie, show, or broadcast. It’s like Giphy without being limited to their library.

We built GemGIF because we can never find the right GIF to send our friends. For example, we might be thinking of that one moment in Breaking Bad where Walter breaks down in hysterical laughter.

With GemGIF, we don’t need to count on a human clipping a scene and adding it to a GIF library. Instead, we describe the GIF and share the video link, and AI will clip the right GIF. Under the hoods, this is powered by Gemini 2’s advanced video understanding capabilities.
